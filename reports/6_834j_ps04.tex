\Large Task: Robot grocery shopping in partially observable settings
\end{center}
\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
Imagine that you're in your bed, hungry, and you just don't want to walk
all the way to the grocery store. Equivalently, imagine you're working, doing the
most exciting task to save humanity, and you have no time to grab food---menial
tasks are beyond you. We'd like a robot which can intelligently learn to shop
groceries for us: it understands a query from the user, moves to the
grocery store, finds the relevant items, purchases it, and comes
back to the user.

In our project we focus on the arguably most difficult of
these tasks, which is to locate the groceries in the store. Moreover, we work
under the realistic
scenario in which the robot can only observe its surroundings (POMDP) rather
than an understanding of where it precisely is in the store (MDP).
The robot has a map of the supermarket (it knows where the walls and aisles are), but 
it does not where items are located on the shelves. 

Given this partially observable setting, the robot should learn how to obtain
all items in the grocery store and do so in an optimal amount of time. It must
1. figure out where it is in the supermarket;
2. intelligently search for the items by learning which aisle corresponds to
which category; and 3. find the optimal path and sequence to obtain all items.
